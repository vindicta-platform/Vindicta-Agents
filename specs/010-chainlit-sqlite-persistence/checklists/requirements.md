# Specification Quality Checklist: Chainlit UI with SQLite Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///c:/Users/bfoxt/vindicta-platform/Vindicta-Agents/specs/010-chainlit-sqlite-persistence/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- SC-001 references "state snapshots" which is business-domain language (not implementation).
- FR-001 mentions `vault/swarm_state.sqlite` — this is an acceptable config path, not implementation detail.
- FR-006 fallback behavior is well-defined without prescribing a specific recovery mechanism.
